# How 15CE Flasher programs the Collector’s Edition

This note explains what happens when you flash firmware with **15CE Flasher**, without assuming you already know SAM-BA jargon.

It is about the **HP 15C Collector’s Edition (CE)** only — the calculator that talks USB over the official pogo programming cable. It does **not** apply to the older Limited Edition or other Voyagers that use a different cable protocol.

---

## Big picture

Think of three actors:

| Who | Where it runs | Job |
|-----|---------------|-----|
| **15CE Flasher** (this Mac app) | Your Mac | Opens the USB link, splits the firmware file into pages, sends commands, checks results |
| **SAM-BA monitor** (“bootloader”) | Inside the calculator’s **flash**, at the bottom | Tiny resident program that wakes in “programming mode” and accepts short commands over USB |
| **Flash applet** | Loaded temporarily into calculator **RAM**, then discarded | Official Atmel helper that knows how to erase/program this chip’s flash hardware |

The Mac app never “pushes bytes straight into flash” for a full firmware update. It loads the applet into RAM, then uses that applet as an on-device flash engine, page by page.

Windows Atmel **SAM-BA** does the same kind of thing with the same family of helper binary. This app is a native Mac host for that path.

---

## Two kinds of memory (this trips everyone up)

The chip has **flash** and **SRAM**. They are different address spaces — like two separate filing cabinets with different number ranges.

### Flash (permanent until rewritten)

Holds programs that survive power-off: the bootloader and the Voyager firmware image.

### SRAM (volatile RAM)

Holds temporary working data. When you leave programming mode or remove power, SRAM content is gone.

**Important:** Address `0x20002000` is **not** “high up in flash.” The `0x2000…` prefix means **SRAM**. Flash lives down near `0x0000…`.

## Graphical memory map — flash (HP 15C CE)

The CE uses an **ATSAM4LC2C** with **128 KB** of flash (`0x00000`–`0x1FFFF`).

15CE Flasher only ever writes the **application** region. It refuses to write below `0x4000`, so the bootloader stays intact.

```text
Flash address        What lives here                         Size

0x1FFFF              └────────────────────────────────────┘
                     (end of 128 KB flash)
```

Same map as a vertical strip:

```text

          ║  BOOTLOADER (SAM-BA)         ║  never overwritten by this app

```

## Graphical memory map — SRAM (during a flash session)

While programming, SRAM is a scratch pad for the USB protocol. Approximate layout used by this stack:

```text
SRAM address         What lives here
───────────────────  ──────────────────────────────────────────────
0x20000000           ┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                     │  SAM-BA monitor workspace                  │
                     │  (romcodesram — monitor’s own RAM use)     │
0x200007FF           └────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        …            (gap — do not park a home-grown blob at
                     0x20001000; this monitor’s Go command expects
                     a proper vector table at the load address)

0x20002000           ┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                     │  Flash applet binary                       │
                     │  applet-flash-sam4l4.bin (~2.6 KB)         │
                     │  Loaded from the Mac, then run.            │
0x20002040           │  Mailbox (commands / status / arguments)   │
                     │  First field: “command” word               │
                     ├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
                     │  Applet code / data continues…             │
                     │  Page buffer (512 bytes) — address told    │
                     │  to the host after INIT                    │
                     └────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

None of this is your Voyager “user memory” in the calculator sense. It is the programming toolchain’s temporary workspace. After reset / leaving programming mode, it is gone.

---

## Programming mode (how the monitor wakes up)

1. Seat the keyed pogo plug in the CE battery bay; USB to the Mac.
2. On the cable: hold **ERASE**, press **RESET**, release **ERASE**.
3. Display stays off. The chip is running the **bootloader**, not the normal calculator UI.
4. The Mac sees a USB CDC device (SAM-BA). The app talks to it with short monitor commands (below).

When you finish: **RESET** on the cable, then turn the calculator **ON**. “Pr Error” is normal — user memory was cleared by the flash.

---

## Monitor commands (the `S#` / `G#` alphabet)

The bootloader understands a tiny text protocol over USB. Commands end with `#`.

| Command | Plain English |
|---------|----------------|
| **`N#`** | “Use binary / non-interactive mode” (less chatty; what the app uses). |
| **`V#`** | “What version are you?” Confirms you are talking to SAM-BA. |
| **`R…#`** | **Read** memory at an address (used for identify and for verify readback). |
| **`w` / `W…#`** | **Write** a small value to an address (used for mailbox fields in SRAM). |
| **`S…#`** | **Send** a block of bytes to an address (upload the applet, or fill the page buffer). |
| **`G…#`** | **Go** — run code at an address (start the applet). |

These commands alone are a poor way to program the whole FLASHCALW controller for a 112 KB image. That is why the **applet** exists.

---

## What the flash applet is

- File name: `applet-flash-sam4l4.bin` (from Atmel SAM-BA 2.16).
- Size: 2,652 bytes.
- License: SAM Software Package License — redistributed and attributed in this project (`THIRD_PARTY.md`). It is **not** HP firmware.
- Lifetime: copied into **SRAM**, used for the session, **not** stored as part of the Voyager application image.

It is a tiny on-device program that speaks FLASHCALW (this chip’s flash controller): unlock, program a page, report status. The Mac is the remote control; the applet is the mechanic with the right tools.

---

## Step-by-step: one full flash

### 1. Connect and identify

App opens the USB port, puts the monitor in binary mode, reads version / chip identity. Optional: **backup** reads today’s application flash (`0x4000`… ) into a file on the Mac.

### 2. Load the applet into SRAM

App sends `S#` aimed at `0x20002000` plus the applet bytes. The binary now sits in RAM.

### 3. Initialize the applet

App writes an **INIT** request into the **mailbox** (a small structure in SRAM at `0x20002040`), then **`G#`** to `0x20002000` to run the applet once.

The applet replies by filling mailbox fields (flash size, page size, where the 512-byte buffer lives, …) and marks the command finished (see “done” signal below).

### 4. Page the new firmware (the Mac is the pager)

The firmware `.bin` is 114,688 bytes. Flash pages on this path are **512 bytes**.

For each page, roughly:

1. App copies that page into the applet’s **SRAM buffer** (`S#`).
2. App writes a **WRITE** command into the mailbox: “program this buffer to flash offset …” (always ≥ `0x4000`).
3. App sends **`G#`** again — applet programs that page.
4. App waits until the applet signals **done**.
5. Next page.

So **paging is driven by the Flasher app**. The applet only ever handles “this one page” when asked.

### 5. How the app knows a page finished (`~cmd`)

There is usually **no** friendly “OK” string back from `G#` in this mode.

Instead, the mailbox’s first word is a **command code** (for example “WRITE” = `0x2`):

1. Host writes `cmd` into the mailbox.
2. Host runs the applet (`G#`).
3. When the applet finishes, it writes **`~cmd`** — the **bitwise NOT** of that same number — into the command word (and a status code beside it).

Example: if `cmd` was `0x00000002`, done looks like `0xFFFFFFFD`.

The app **polls that mailbox word** until it sees `~cmd`. That means “this applet operation finished,” **not** “I compared flash to the file yet.”

### 6. Verify (separate step)

After all pages are programmed, the app can **read the application flash back** and compare it to the file you selected. That is a real content check of flash, independent of the mailbox handshake.

### 7. Restart and checksum on the calculator

You reset out of programming mode and use the calculator’s own test/checksum UI to confirm what the silicon thinks it has — a second, human-visible check.

## Why not write flash directly from the Mac?

People have tried “just `W#` / poke the flash controller from the host.” On this CE hardware that path tends to **kill the USB session** or leave the monitor hung. The flash controller needs the careful sequence the official applet implements.

So the design is deliberate:

- **Host** = policy (never below `0x4000`), paging, USB timing, verify.
- **Applet** = proven FLASHCALW programmer in SRAM.
- **Bootloader** = USB front door that must remain in flash.
